Drivers can be selected in Menu/Administration/Driver Manager
Nvidia driver/gpu use is not straigthforward
Best working solution (unless more computing power is required) is to
use open source driver "nouveau" (does this really use the graphic card
or just intel integrated GPU ?) under kernel 4.8
4.10 seems to require the nvidia driver ?
Also it seems that propriary driver should be removed/reinstalled when
switching kernel
